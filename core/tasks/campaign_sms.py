# core/tasks/campaign_sms.py
"""
Campaign SMS send + delivery-check pipeline.

Two Celery beat tasks:

    send_due_campaign_sms()
        Finds trigger_results rows that are ready to send (final_message
        already populated by the existing pg_cron job running
        fill_final_messages(), send_sms_date already populated by the
        existing pg_cron job running process_campaign_send_dates(), and
        sent_at still NULL), sends them via sms.ir's send_like_to_like,
        and stamps sent_at + sms_message_id.

    check_campaign_sms_delivery()
        Finds trigger_results rows that have been sent but not yet
        confirmed delivered, looks up each one's delivery status via
        sms.ir's report_message, and stamps delivered_at on confirmed
        deliveries.

Both tasks are idempotent-safe to re-run: send only picks up rows with
sent_at IS NULL, so a message is never sent twice by this task alone
(a genuine double-send could still happen if the task crashes AFTER
sms.ir accepts the batch but BEFORE the DB write commits — see the
per-row try/except below, which stamps sent_at defensively as soon as
each individual send is confirmed rather than batching all DB writes
until the very end).

Neither task touches fill_final_messages() or process_campaign_send_dates()
— those remain pg_cron jobs in Supabase, untouched by this phase.

    Celery beat task — runs on the interval configured in

    Picks up trigger_results rows where:

    different line number in the future; for now all tenants share the
    single configured SMSIR_CAMPAIGN_LINE_NUMBER, but grouping by tenant
    keeps this task forward-compatible with per-tenant lines without a
