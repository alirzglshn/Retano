Retano BI – Campaign Automation Panel (Django)

This project is a Django-based campaign management panel designed to integrate with a WordPress e-commerce website.
It allows store owners to create rule-based marketing campaigns and automatically send personalized messages (e.g. SMS) to customers.

The panel runs on a separate Django subdomain and is securely accessed from WordPress using JWT authentication.
